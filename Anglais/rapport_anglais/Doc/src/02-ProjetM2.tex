\section{Abstract}

The main objective of our project is to be able to make a 360-degree video representation of any object. To do this, a camera will have to take photos of the object you want to represent at regular intervals. This object will be placed on a turntable. The STM32 will have to manage the rotation of this plateau but also the triggering of photos. The user can act on the number of photos to be taken for a complete revolution of the turntable in order to obtain a more or less precise rendering.

In this document we will discuss the evoltions of the project since the presentation that we realised in english classroom.
